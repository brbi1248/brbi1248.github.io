            <h2>Week 5: September 22 - September 28</h2>
            <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Edited my portfolio website to ensure it doesn't skew left on mobile devices.</li>
                <li>Practiced STAR interview questions.</li>
                <li>Completed a few leetcode questions.</li>
                <li>Made progress with my predictive model:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analyzed the correlation matrix.</li>
                    <li>Considered predictive questions and suitable models:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Predict future purchase behavior based on historical data → Regression.</li>
                        <li>Predict whether a customer will make a purchase or not → Classification.</li>
                        <li>Segment customers into groups based on purchase behaviors and characteristics → Clustering.</li>
                        <li>Evaluate the effectiveness of discounts and promotions → Classification.</li>
                        <li>Estimate the total value a customer will bring over their lifetime → Regression.</li>
                        <li>Recommend products or offers based on customer preferences and behavior → KNN.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Work on leetcode questions for data structures, SQL, and pandas.</li>
                <li>Pick one of the questions and start building the model. I’m leaning toward the first classification idea: predicting whether a customer will make a purchase or not.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It's difficult to focus on what I should be practicing on leetcode since I'm applying for many positions. My ideal job is in data science or data analytics, so I know pandas and SQL are important. However, I've also been applying for software developer roles, so data structures seem relevant. I'm uncertain if I should focus on a specific path, but I don’t want to limit myself.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week: How can you improve it?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I crammed a lot at the end of the week because I was studying for a test and had a challenging lab that took priority. I want to dedicate at least an hour each day to my professional development goals, but some weeks are more difficult than others.</li>
