            <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Unfortunately, due to a planned trip followed by catching COVID in the latter half of the week, I wasn’t able to accomplish much.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Begin reviewing the online course and take notes for interviews.</li>
                <li>Practice SQL and Pandas questions on LeetCode.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm still recovering, but I should be able to practice and review the Coursera material. Coursera has steep prices—$60 per month. I want to start the free trial and make the most of it by practicing during my free time over the break. I can then decide if the content is worth continuing the course.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflection on last week’s process and how to improve it:</h3>
            <p>I don’t think I’ve made much progress because I was sick and had to juggle a trip. My main priorities were taking an exam and completing a lab, so I had to focus on those over my project. Now that I’m back home and recovering, I hope to resume reviewing data science materials.</p>
