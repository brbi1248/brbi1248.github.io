            <h2>Week 7: October 6 - October 12</h2>
            <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Did research on how to do case interviews.</li>
                <li>Practiced behavioral and case interview questions.</li>
                <li>Practiced LeetCode questions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to improve my logistic regression model and then move to random forest.</li>
                <li>Keep practicing behavioral and case study questions.</li>
                <li>Practice SQL questions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>With several upcoming interviews, it's been challenging to balance my time between practicing behavioral and technical questions and working on my predictive model.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
            <p>
                I wanted to dedicate time to both interview preparation and my predictive model, but unfortunately, my model was set aside as I got caught up in researching case study interviews. It took more time than I expected, and practicing for it didn't feel intuitive at all. I understand that these things happen, so moving forward, I'll cut myself some slack: some weeks I'll focus more on interview questions, and other weeks I'll devote more effort to my predictive model.
