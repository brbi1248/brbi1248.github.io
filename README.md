# Brittany's Professional Development Project Weekly Updates
## A place where I post my weekly progress of my professional development project
	
 ### Week 2: September 1 - September 7
- What did you do last week?
  - I brainstormed ideas for my predictive modeling project datasets and narrowed it down to three:
    - Analyze and predict user behavior on instagram based on likes and postings. Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjanchaudhari/user-behavior-on-instagram
    - Predict user's well being based on their social media usage. Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanai/social-media-usage-and-emotional-well-being
    - Analyze and predict consumer behavior based on demographics and shopping habits. Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset
  - Did research on the python packages I would like to use and narrowed it down to two:
      - Scikit-Learn for simpler methods like logistic regresssion, random forest, classification, etc, in the beginning: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
      - Pytorch for more advanced modeling with neural networks later: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html
  - Practiced interviewing soft skills by writing down several stories for interviewing question with star (situation, task, action, result) methods.
  - Had my husband who is a hiring manager grill me on these stories.
  - Practiced several medium sql questions on leetcode to keep my skills refreshed.
    
- What do you plan to do this week?
    - Decide on which dataset most interests me and think of which modeling method I would like to start with.
    - Analyze that dataset for which variables look the most interesting.
    - Practice the star method more.
    - Decide on the IDE needed to start this project and what packages I need to clean and prep this dataset with.
- Are there any impediments in your way?
    - I haven't cleaned or prepared a dataset in a year so it will take some time looking through my old notes on how to start.
    - It will take some trial and error learning how to use scikit-learn and pytorch. 
- Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
    - I don't think I used my time efficiently and just lumped all my research into one day. I would like to spread out my project over multiple days so I don't get mentally overwhelmed by all the information.
