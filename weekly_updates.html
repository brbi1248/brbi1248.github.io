            <h2>Week 2: September 1 - September 7</h2>
            <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I brainstormed ideas for my predictive modeling project datasets and narrowed it down to three:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjanchaudhari/user-behavior-on-instagram">Analyze and predict user behavior on Instagram based on likes and postings</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanai/social-media-usage-and-emotional-well-being">Predict user's well-being based on their social media usage</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset">Analyze and predict consumer behavior based on demographics and shopping habits</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Did research on the Python packages I would like to use and narrowed it down to two:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Scikit-Learn for simpler methods like logistic regression, random forest, classification, etc.</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html">PyTorch for more advanced modeling with neural networks</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Practiced interviewing soft skills by writing down several stories for interviewing questions with STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) methods.</li>
                <li>Had my husband, who is a hiring manager, grill me on these stories.</li>
                <li>Practiced several medium SQL questions on LeetCode to keep my skills refreshed.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Decide on which dataset most interests me and think of which modeling method I would like to start with.</li>
                <li>Analyze that dataset for which variables look the most interesting.</li>
                <li>Practice the STAR method more.</li>
                <li>Decide on the IDE needed to start this project and what packages I need to clean and prep this dataset with.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I haven't cleaned or prepared a dataset in a year, so it will take some time looking through my old notes on how to start.</li>
                <li>It will take some trial and error learning how to use Scikit-Learn and PyTorch.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
            <p>I don't think I used my time efficiently and just lumped all my research into one day. I would like to spread out my project over multiple days so I don't get mentally overwhelmed by all the information.</p>
