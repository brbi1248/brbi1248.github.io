        <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
        <p>This project aims to develop a predictive model based on human behavior. The primary goals are to enhance my resume in pursuit of a data science role, refresh my skills in dataset preparation, and learn new modeling techniques. I am particularly interested in exploring human behavior, a topic I have not previously examined in depth. Ultimately, I hope to have a project that I can confidently discuss during interviews, showcasing my proficiency with two prominent machine learning Python packages: Scikit-Learn and PyTorch.</p>
        
        <h2>Motivation: Why is this project important to you?</h2>
        <p>This project is important to me because it focuses on a predictive model that genuinely interests me, beyond the scope of class assignments. I believe that having a personal project to speak passionately about will significantly benefit my performance in interviews.</p>
        
        <h2>Specific and Measurable Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Clean and prepare the dataset.</li>
            <li>Analyze the dataset to identify key variables that contribute to the model.</li>
            <li>Select 2 to 3 models that best suit the dataset.</li>
            <li>Create testing and training datasets if necessary.</li>
            <li>Train the model and adjust variables to achieve high accuracy.</li>
            <li>Develop a more advanced model using neural networks.</li>
            <li>Fine-tune the neural network model to improve accuracy.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Risks to Project Completion</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Limited experience with neural networks.</li>
            <li>Potential skill gaps due to a year-long hiatus from machine learning.</li>
            <li>Risk of choosing unsuitable models for the dataset, leading to potential rework.</li>
            <li>Lack of experience with PyTorch.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Mitigation Strategies for Risks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Review the PyTorch documentation thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Revisit past machine learning projects to refresh my skills.</li>
            <li>Seek guidance from my data science professor for additional support.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Project Assessments: Evaluation Criteria</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The dataset is thoroughly cleaned and prepared.</li>
            <li>A detailed analysis of the dataset is completed.</li>
            <li>At least 2-3 models are developed with an accuracy of 85% or higher.</li>
            <li>A neural network model is created and demonstrates decent accuracy.</li>
        </ul>
