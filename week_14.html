            <ul>
                <li>Reviewed the first modules of IBM's machine learning and data science courses.</li>
                <li>Practiced SQL and Pandas questions on LeetCode.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Review the second module of IBM's courses.</li>
                <li>Continue practicing coding questions on LeetCode.</li>
                <li>Look for a new dataset to work with after finishing the Coursera courses.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The IBM modules are straightforward to navigate, and I don't anticipate any issues completing them. The initial modules were relatively simple and served to set the stage for how the courses will progress. I'm excited to dive deeper into the more advanced content and apply new techniques to a dataset.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflection on last week’s process and how to improve it:</h3>
            <p>There wasn’t much to improve upon last week since it was a break, allowing me to focus entirely on the IBM courses. I’m looking forward to maintaining this momentum in the coming weeks as I continue with the course.</p>
