            <h2>Week 3: September 8 - September 14</h2>
            <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I noticed that many job postings request a personal website, so I got the idea from this class to create a website to showcase my portfolio. I spent most of the week designing and creating this webpage, which directs recruiters to my projects on GitHub: <a href="https://brbi1248.github.io/brittanybilottiportfolio/">https://brbi1248.github.io/brittanybilottiportfolio/</a>
                </li>
                <li>I edited my resume.</li>
                <li>Practiced the STAR method.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Since I decided to prioritize the website and resume editing, I will focus on what I originally intended to do this week, next week:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose a dataset that most interests me and decide which modeling method to start with.</li>
                    <li>Analyze the dataset to identify the most interesting variables.</li>
                    <li>Practice the STAR method more.</li>
                    <li>Decide on the IDE needed to start this project and determine what packages I need to clean and prepare the dataset.</li>
                    <li>Continue editing my website.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mostly my own indecisiveness. I have three datasets I'm considering, and I'm leaning towards two of them. I might end up working with both if I have time.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week: How can you improve it?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Apart from changing my focus, I think I did well this week. However, I could have asked for advice on how to structure my website.</li>
