            <h2>Week 8: October 13 - October 19</h2>
            <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practiced behavioral and case study interviews.</li>
                <li>Created a data science interview question cheat sheet and reviewed the key concepts.</li>
                <li>Practiced LeetCode questions.</li>
                <li>Decided to split my model project into two parts, focusing on both a continuous and categorical target.</li>
                <li>For the second model, I chose purchase amount as the target and selected variables moderately or highly correlated with it.</li>
                <li>Prepared my variables and split the data into training and testing sets.</li>
                <li>Decided to start with a simple linear regression model.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Continue working on the model with purchase amount as the continuous target, improving the simple linear regression model through feature engineering.</li>
                <li>If the simple model is insufficient, I plan to use TensorFlow to build a more complex linear regression model with hyperparameter tuning.</li>
                <li>Refine my interview preparation as needed.</li>
                <li>Practice more LeetCode questions if time permits.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Now that my interviews are over, I can focus on my model in greater detail! I don't anticipate any obstacles this week, as I'll have more time to dedicate to my work.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
            <p>
                Considering I was balancing interviews and preparation, I feel I did my best last week. I managed to maintain a steady pace with both interview prep and my model, and I'm satisfied with the progress.
