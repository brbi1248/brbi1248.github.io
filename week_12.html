            <h2>Week 12: November 10 - November 16</h2>
            <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Finished my regression model:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used gradient boosting, random forest, and linear regression models for comparison.</li>
                    <li>The gradient boosting model performed best, so I chose it to move forward.</li>
                    <li>Performed additional feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning on the model.</li>
                    <li>Analyzed important features and created a key insights summary.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Found an online course to review machine learning: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?isNewUser=true">Coursera Machine Learning Course</a></li>
                <li>Practiced technical and behavioral interview questions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Begin reviewing the online course and take notes for interviews.</li>
                <li>Practice SQL and Pandas questions on LeetCode.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to get much done because of a trip I’m on this week. I’ll be back this weekend, so I’ll try to get some work done then.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflection on last week’s process and how to improve it:</h3>
            <p>Working on this machine learning project has had its ups and downs, especially since I haven’t taken a class with machine learning in a while. I think it’s important to take some time to review material through this online course before moving on to a more complex machine learning model.</p>
