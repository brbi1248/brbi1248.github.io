            <h2>Week 11: November 3 - November 9</h2>
            <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Optimized my linear regression model:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analyzed important features and dropped features with the lowest importance.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Completed a take-home classification model for an interview.</li>
                <li>Practiced technical and behavioral interview questions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Finish my regression model:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use a random forest regression model and compare it with the linear regression model's results.</li>
                        <li>Analyze feature interactions.</li>
                        <li>Use hypertuning for better model performance.</li>
                        <li>Create a summary of key findings.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Begin looking for machine learning certifications/courses to refresh my skillset.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This week is a lot more open than the last few weeks prior. Now that I don't have any more take-home assignments, I can focus on finishing my model and trying to find certifications that will benefit me the most.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Reflection on last weekâ€™s process and how to improve it:</h3>
            <p>
                I think I balanced my time wisely between both my linear regression project and take-home assignment by starting earlier in the week and switching off between the two.
