            <h2>Week 10: October 27 - November 2</h2>
            <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Found a new Kaggle dataset that aligned with my love for wine: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009">Red Wine Quality Dataset</a></li>
                <li>Did minor clean-up of this dataset.</li>
                <li>Performed an EDA:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Evaluated all variables and chose my own target variable suitable for a linear regression task: alcohol percentage.</li>
                        <li>Evaluated other variables with visualizations and correlation tests.</li>
                        <li>Performed a baseline linear regression model and feature importance analysis.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Continue optimizing my linear regression model.</li>
                <li>Explore other model types if the simple linear regression model does not perform well.</li>
                <li>Analyze the best features to use in the chosen model.</li>
                <li>Work on another take-home classification model from an interview.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Balancing my take-home assignment with my personal project may be challenging, but my practice and streamlined process for building predictive models make it more manageable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflection on last week’s process and how to improve it:</h3>
            <p>
                I’ve learned to focus on EDA more closely, which made last week’s process smoother. I don't think I could improve upon it any further.
