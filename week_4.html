            <h2>Week 4: September 15 - September 21</h2>
            <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I created a project portfolio website to showcase my GitHub projects.</li>
                <li>I chose one of the three datasets from Kaggle and started working on my predictive modeling project:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Performed exploratory data analysis using pandas and numpy</li>
                    <li>Created visualizations with seaborn to better understand the variables in the data</li>
                    <li>Cleaned the data by encoding categorical variables into numerical ones to create a correlation matrix</li>
                    <li>Practiced LeetCode questions on pandas and data structures in Python</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Continue with my predictive model:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analyze the correlation matrix</li>
                    <li>Identify a target variable or multiple targets and determine which predictive models would be best suited for the problem posed by the target variables</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Edit my website to display correctly on mobile screens—right now, it skews to the left and does not adjust properly</li>
                <li>Practice the STAR method for an upcoming phone interview</li>
                <li>Practice more LeetCode questions</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I don’t have many impediments, but time might be an issue. I may need to limit the number of LeetCode questions I practice or skip them to focus on my predictive model tasks.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week: How can you improve it?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Last week, I think I did very well! I was able to divide my time between working on my website in the first half of the week and my predictive model in the second half. I got a lot done because I had enough time. I hope this week will be the same.</li>
